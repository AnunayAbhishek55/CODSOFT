# Java Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a set of simple yet functional Java console applications, each focusing on fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming, and API integration.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Guess the Number Game

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Currency Converter (Bonus)
A single-file Java program that fetches **real-time currency exchange rates** from an online API and converts an amount from a base currency to a target currency.

**Features:**
- User selects base and target currency codes
- Fetches latest rates from `https://api.exchangerate.host/`
- Converts the entered amount and displays results with currency codes
- Error handling for failed API requests

**Concepts Used:** HTTP Requests, JSON Parsing, API Integration, User Input
